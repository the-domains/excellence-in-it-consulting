Using a professional Computer Consultancy service such as N2IT, enables you to be in a stronger position when negotiating for new computer equipment.

An outside IT consultant can provide another perspective on contract negotiations and operate as an impartial party. Using one can help prevent against costly errors in contract negotiations.
